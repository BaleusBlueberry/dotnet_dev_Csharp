*Step 1:

 *1.Build a class called GameBoard

 * 2.add a field 2d array of char - that will represent the virtual game board

 * 3. build a method called "ResetBoard" that sets all the values of the board to ' '

 * 4. build a method called "DisplayBoard" that prints out the current state of the game board. ** BONUS - add some colors

 * 5. build a method called "MakeMove" that updates the gameboard with the players move

 * 6. build a method called "IsValidMove" that checks if the given move is valid, meaning in range and not taken place already

 * 7. build a method called "CheckWin" that checks if a given 'X' or 'O' has won.

 * 8. build a method called "IsBoardFull" that checks if the gameboard is full up.
