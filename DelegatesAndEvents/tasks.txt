/*
		 *
		 * Step 1: create a delegate called "TimerNotification"
		 * returns void and takes an integer
		 *
		 * Step 2: Create a Timer class

		 * create 2 events using the delegate above:
		 * TimerTick
		 * TimerCompleted
		 *
		 * Step 3:
		 * Add a function to the Timer class called "Start" that
		 * takes an integer (time to run in seconds)

		 * the function needs to loop the amount given in the parameter
		 * each iteration sleep for 1000 milli seconds and then raise
		 * the TimerTick event.
		 * When the loop completes, call the TimerCompleted event.
		 *
		 * Step 4:
		 * in the Main
		 * create an instance of Timer
		 * register for each of the events with a function suited
		 * call the "Start" on the timer and run the code
		 *
		 * verify that you get the tick event notifications
		 * and the completed
		 *
